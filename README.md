# Reversi Game 

Interactive Reversi (Othello) game implemented in Python with a Tkinter GUI and an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

## ✨ Features

- **Tkinter GUI**  
  Interactive 8×8 board with visual cues for valid moves, dynamic updates, and score tracking.  
- **AI Opponent**  
  Computer player powered by the Minimax algorithm with heuristic evaluation.   
- **Difficulty Levels**  
  Choose from easy (random), medium (minimax), or hard (heuristic-tactical) strategies.  

## 🧠 Minimax Algorithm

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate potential moves and choose strategies that maximize its advantage, encouraging players to plan several turns ahead.

- **Depth-limited search** for efficient performance  
- **Heuristic evaluation** to assess board states  
- **Configurable difficulty** by adjusting search depth
